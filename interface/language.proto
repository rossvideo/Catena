 * Text that a client can display in one of multiple languages.

 *
 * When defined in-line, the keys shall be patterned on those defined at
 * https://www.mesaonline.org/language-metadata-table with "example"
 * substituted by "catena".
 *

 * {

 *    "fr": "Bonjour", // global French
 *    "fr-CA": "Bonjour", // Canadian French
 * }
 *
 * And when defined by reference to a language pack the key property
 * is used to provide a look-up into the supported LanguagePack(s)
 * e.g. key = "greeting" could index to "Hello", "Hola" or "Bonjour"
 * depending on which LanguagePack was active in the client.
 *
 * Neither the polyglot or key members need be used.
 *
 * The monoglot member is provided to allow use of this message type
 * without or before multi-language support being available. And use
 * of clients that do not provide multi-language support.
 * It should always be provided.
 * e.g. monoglot = "Hello"
