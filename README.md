Catena is a standardization of communication methods between (micro)services and full products – designed for hybrid cloud and on-premises solutions with the goal of making it easy to secure, connect and control a multi-vendor ecosystem of media processing services and microservices no matter where they are. 

The Catena specification is currently in discussion with OSA with the goal of SMPTE standardization.


Catena is based on lessons learned and experience with Ross Video’s openGear platform, which is:
* A successful (Emmy-winning) initiative
* In existence since 2006
* An open de-facto standard to the broadcast industry
* Used by over 100 partner companies in the openGear and DashBoard ecosystem

Catena SDK is an open-source project led by Ross Video.
